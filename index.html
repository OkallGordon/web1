I also attended <span class="highlight">Orero Boys High School</span>, where my early passion for coding began.</p>

                        <h4>1. Public Participation System for County Government</h4>
                        <p>One of my proudest accomplishments is the development of a Digital Public Participation System for my county government. This system was designed to address a critical problem: the lack of transparency and citizen involvement in parliamentary decision-making.</p>
                        
                        <p>Before the system's implementation, many Gen Z-led protests erupted due to the perception that elected officials were passing oppressive bills without community consent. Traditional barazas (public forums) failed to reach a majority of citizens, allowing representatives to misrepresent their constituents' opinions.</p>
                        
                        <p>By creating a secure digital platform, I empowered citizens to participate directly in government decisions by sharing their feedback on bills, proposals, and projects. This platform ensured that individual opinions were accurately recorded without manipulation or distortion. The results were transformative:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Citizen engagement increased significantly, with nearly 3/4 of the population now participating in decision-making processes.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrations reduced, and the platform became a tool for fostering trust between the government and its citizens.</li>
                            <li>Public discourse improved as more diverse voices were heard, promoting more inclusive and transparent governance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This project exemplified my ability to design user-centric, impactful solutions for large-scale social challenges.</p>

                    <div class="project-card">
                        <h4>2. Rental Management System</h4>
                        <p>I also developed a Rental Management System that automated traditional property management processes for landlords. Before this system, many landlords relied on cumbersome, error-prone paperwork to manage tenant information, rent collection, and communication.</p>
                        
                        <p>With this system, landlords could:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Manage tenants online, reducing administrative burdens.</li>
                            <li>Track rent payments and automate reminders for due payments.</li>
                            <li>Store tenant records digitally, ensuring easy retrieval and enhanced data security.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The system helped streamline operations, improve tenant communication, and reduce the risk of human errors. Its intuitive design ensured a seamless experience for both landlords and tenants, making it a highly efficient tool for property management.</p>

                        <h4>3. Money Transfer Web Application</h4>
                        <p>Inspired by systems like M-Pesa, I developed a Money Transfer Web Application that allows users to send and receive money in real time. The platform includes the following key features:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Instant Transfers: Users can send money instantly, with balances updated immediately.</li>
                            <li>Balance Checks: Users can easily check their account balance and transaction history.</li>
                            <li>Security Features: The system includes secure authentication and encryption to protect user data and transactions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This platform demonstrated my ability to build financial systems with high reliability and performance, meeting the growing demand for secure and accessible digital payment solutions. The system's seamless user experience and robust functionality were designed to support users globally, ensuring no limitations based on location or prior account registration.</p>
